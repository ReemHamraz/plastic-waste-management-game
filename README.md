# 🤿 Plastic Dive

I am proud to present my very first game 🙌

I hope you enjoy it!

### 🎮 [Play the game (Web)](https://plastic-dive.web.app/)


## 🐡 Description

### 🎯 Objectives

Plastic Dive is a small game where you play the role of a diver who has to collect plastic waste in the ocean. Each garbage collected will give you points and those can be used to upgrade your diver to dive and swim deeper, faster, longer or to improve your garbage collection speed. But make sure to be back at the surface before your oxygen tank is empty or you will lose the game and all the points you have collected. Be the best diver and reach the top of the leaderboard 🏆

The game is also educational and will teach you about the plastic pollution and the animals living in the ocean. 

You can play it either with the keyboard arrows or a joystick.
